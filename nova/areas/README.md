# Areas

## Purpose
Areas are consistent workspaces for parallel tracks. Each area uses the same file structure so the agent can operate predictably.

## Structure
- goals.md: north star, objectives, scope
- plan.md: strategy, milestones, change log
- next-task.md: single executable action
- metrics.md: primary/secondary metrics + snapshots
- reviews/: periodic retrospectives (not fixed cadence)

## Workflow
1. Read next-task.md to decide what to do now.
2. Update plan.md when strategy or milestones change.
3. Record important outcomes in reviews/.
4. Track progress in metrics.md.

## Naming
Create new areas by copying example_area/.
Example template area lives in example_area/.
